# HEPRS

We introduces a novel application of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for secure and private computation of Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) in genomic studies. Focusing on schizophrenia risk prediction, our work employs FHE to perform computations on encrypted genotype data, preserving the privacy and security of sensitive genetic information. Utilizing the CKKs protocol within the Lattigo library, this approach maintains the confidentiality of both genomic data and PRS models within a three-party system involving clients, modelers, and evaluators.
